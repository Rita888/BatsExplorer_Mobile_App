GitHub Repository (https://github.com/Rita888/BatsExplorer_Mobile_App.git)

Extended Submission Date 18th May 2022

## Introduction to Application

This app has been developed to allow easier data logging and sending data about bat species that have been logged. This app is in its initial phase of design and needs further work. 
Further work would include real live data displays from MQTT that streams live data from static bat detectors based in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. If non-static detectors such as echo-meter
to detect bats then automatically data recorded on the phone would be sent to local ecological records centre.
